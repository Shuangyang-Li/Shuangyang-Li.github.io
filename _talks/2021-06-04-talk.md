Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has attracted substantial attention recently. It has demonstrated superior performance compared to the conventional orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation in the high-Doppler scenarios. Therefore, it has been widely acknowledged as a potential key enabler for emerging applications, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites. In this presentation, we will summarize some recent advances on OTFS modulation, with a specific focus on its performance analysis with channel coding and signal detection. In particular, we will unveil the trade-off between the coding gain and diversity gain for OTFS modulation. We will also discuss how the unitary transformations between different domains, such as the time-delay domain and the delay-Doppler domain, can help the signal detection.
