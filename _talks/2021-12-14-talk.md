The recently proposed orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has provided a new perspective for communication designs for future wireless systems. In contrast to conventional multi-carrier modulation schemes, OTFS modulation innovatively multiplexes the information data in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain rather than the well-known time-frequency (TF) domain. Thus, it provides many appealing advantages for communication designs, such as potential full-diversity and low-complexity transmitter/receiver implementation. In this talk, we will present the recent advances of DD domain signal processing for communications and discuss the reasons why it is good. In specific, this talk will cover several developments of OTFS modulation from different perspectives, including the achievable rate analysis, channel coding, cross domain detection, multi-user MIMO design, and integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), where important insights on DD domain communication designs will also be highlighted.
