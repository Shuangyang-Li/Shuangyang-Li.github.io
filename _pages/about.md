# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-fw"></i> About me #

I am a Marie-Curie Research Fellow with the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in Technical University of Berlin (TU-Berlin), under the supervision of Professor [Giuseppe Caire](https://www.tu.berlin/commit). Priori to that, I was a research associate at School of Engineering in University of Western Australia (UWA), under the supervision of Professor [David Huang](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/david-huang). I have received my B.S., M.S., and Ph. D. degrees from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2013, 2016, and 2021, respectively. My Ph. D. supervisor in Xidian University was Professor [Baoming Bai](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/bmbai/index.html). Additionally, I have received my second Ph. D. degree from University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, Australia, in 2022. My Ph. D. supervisors in UNSW were Professor [Jinhong Yuan](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/jinhong-yuan) and Professor [Derrick Wing Kwan Ng](http://www2.ee.unsw.edu.au/~derrick/). I was a member of the [Wireless Communication Lab](http://www2.ee.unsw.edu.au/wcl/index.html) at UNSW. I am currently serving as the [editor for IEEE Transactions on Communications](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tcom/ieee-transactions-communications-editorial-board) and a [co-chair of the OTFS special interest group (SIG)](https://sites.google.com/view/otfs-sig/sig-members?authuser=0) of IEEE Communications Society.

My research interests include:

* Orthogonal Time Frequency Space Modulation
* Waveform Design
* Channel Coding
* Applied Information Theory
