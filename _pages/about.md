# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-fw"></i> About me #

I am a research associate at School of Engineering in University of Western Australia (UWA), under the supervision of Professor [David Huang](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/david-huang). I have received my B.S., M.S., and Ph. D. degrees from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2013, 2016, and 2021, respectively. My Ph. D. supervisor in Xidian University was Professor [Baoming Bai](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/bmbai/index.html). Additionally, I have received my second Ph. D. degree from University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, Australia, in 2022. My Ph. D. supervisors in UNSW was Professor [Jinhong Yuan](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/jinhong-yuan) and Professor [Derrick Wing Kwan Ng](http://www2.ee.unsw.edu.au/~derrick/) in the [Wireless Communication Lab](http://www2.ee.unsw.edu.au/wcl/index.html).  

My research interests include:

* Orthogonal Time Frequency Space Modulation
* Waveform Design
* Channel Coding
* Applied Information Theory
